  summary: 'Lightweight computation graphs for Python'
  description: |
    NetworkFoX is a fork of graphkit, which adds the
    ability to do computations on top of NetworkX
    graphs. It stands for Network F of X. The
    features NetworkFoX adds to graphkit are: Control
    flow nodes, such as If, ElseIf, and Else. Type
    annotations and type checking for function inputs
    and outputs. Coloring nodes in a graph and
    evaluating only nodes of a given color. Picklable
    graphs. Fixing various bugs in graphkit.
